ACC & Adaptive Cruise Control & An optional cruise control system for road vehicles that automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. \\
App & Application software & Computer software designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user. \\
 & Arduino & An open source computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. \\
AR & Augmented Reality & An interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities. \\
 & Backseat driver & A passenger in a car who gives usually unwanted driving advice to the driver. Or in general someone who gives unwanted advice or who tries to control something that is supposed to be controlled by another person. \\
 & Bit banging & A colloquial term used to describe various techniques in which serial communications utilize software instead of dedicated hardware to process and make use of signals. Software directly sets and samples the state of pins on a microcontroller, and is responsible for all parameters of the signal: timing, levels, synchronization, etc. \\
BSW & Blind Spot Warning & A vehicle-based sensor device that detects other vehicles or bicycles located to the driver’s side and rear. \\
Bosch CM & Bosch Car Multimedia & A manufacturer of car multimedia systems such as speakers, radios and navigation systems that originated out of Blaupunkt GmbH. \\

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{smb}
& Bresenham Algorithm & An algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image. \\
& Broadcom & An American fabless semiconductor company that organizes the fabrication of the processor chip and the wifi processor which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi Foundation. \\
CAN bus & Controller Area Network & A robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. \\
FCW & Forward Collision Warning & Uses a radar to detect vehicles or obstacles in front of the car. \\
 & Handshaking & An automated process of negotiation between two communicating participants through the exchange of information that establishes the protocols of a communication link at the start of the communication, before full communication begins. \\
HUD & Head Up Display & A head-up display is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned "up" and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments. \\
 & Instrument cluster & A dashboard (also called dash or instrument cluster) is a control panel usually located directly ahead of a vehicle's driver, displaying instrumentation and controls for the vehicle's operation. \\
I2C & Inter-Integrated Circuit & A synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, serial computer bus. It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. \\
 & Jerk, snap & A quick sudden movement. In physics is jerk the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the time derivative of acceleration, and as such the second derivative of velocity (snap is the third), or the third time derivative of position. \\

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{smb}
LDW & Lane Departure Warning & Systems which warn the driver (lane departure warning, LDW) if the vehicle is leaving its lane (visual, audible, and/or vibration warnings) \\
LKS & Lane Keeping Systems & Systems which warn the driver and, if no action is taken, automatically take steps to ensure the vehicle stays in its lane (lane keeping system, LKS) \\
LIDAR & Light Imaging, Detection, and Ranging & A surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. \\
Led & Light-Emitting Diode & A two-lead semiconductor light source. \\
 & Likert Scale & A psychometric scale commonly involved in research that employs questionnaires. \\
LCD & Liquid-Crystal Display & A flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome. \\
 & LUX sensor & The lux is the SI derived unit of illuminance and luminous emittance, measuring luminous flux per unit area. It is equal to one lumen per square metre. \\
 & Modality & In the context of human–computer interaction, a modality is the classification of a single independent channel of sensory input/output between a computer and a human. A system is designated unimodal if it has only one modality implemented, and multimodal if it has more than one. \\
 & Mood Tech & All technology that can enhance mood (mood lighting) and also technology that reacts to mood. \\
NHTSA & National Highway Traffic Safety Administration & The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, pronounced "NITS-uh") is an agency of the Executive Branch of the U.S. government, part of the Department of Transportation. It describes its mission as "Save lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes." \\

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{smb}
NUIs & Natural User Interface & A user interface that is effectively invisible, and remains invisible as the user continuously learns increasingly complex interactions. \\
OEM & Original Equipment Manufacturer & A company that produces parts and equipment that may be marketed by another manufacturer. When referring to auto parts, OEM refers to the manufacturer of the original equipment, that is, the parts assembled and installed during the construction of a new vehicle. \\
 & Processing & An open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) / playground built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context. \\
PWM & Pulse-Width Modulation & A modulation technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal. \\
 & Question Zero & A routine for creative thought-providing questions from hardvard business school. \\
 & Retrofitting & Refers to the addition of new technology or features to older systems. \\
Sedric & SElf DRiving Car & Sedric is the first Concept Car from the Volkswagen Group. And it is the first vehicle in the group to have been created for level 5 of autonomous driving –in other words a person as a human driver is no longer required. \\
TaaS & Transportation-as-a-Service & Describes a shift away from personally-owned modes of transportation and towards mobility solutions that are consumed as a service \\
UX & User Experience & Refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. \\
V2X & Vehicle To everything & A vehicular communication system that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure), V2V (Vehicle-to-vehicle), V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian), V2D (Vehicle-to-device) and V2G (Vehicle-to-grid). \\
