\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}
For passengers in fully autonomous vehicles, not being able to anticipate upcoming actions can be discerning. My product idea addresses this issue by communicating driving decisions in advance, via light signals in passengers' peripheral vision. 
The literature research, ideation, design, and prototyping are described. This thesis gives guidance in developing ambient displays of this kind, shows a solution to prototype light messages for varying interiors and lays out possibilities for user studies . 

In one WoZ-based on-the-road-driving simulation with 14 participants, the aiding effect of feedforward information was affirmed. Two workshops with mobility-impaired people suggest that multi-modal feedforward information will be a necessity for them to make use out of the promises of autonomous vehicles. The motion of the ambient display activates the passengers attention to changes of inertia, in future work this mitigating effect on car sickness should be analyzed. 

%Then, the abstract in the other language (explicit language selection) except for bachelor's theses
