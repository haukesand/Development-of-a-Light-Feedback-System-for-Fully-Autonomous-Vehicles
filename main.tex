\begin{document}

\maketitle


%First, the abstract in the language of the thesis (no language selection). Note that most fields are already defined

\thesisdescription{Master of Science Thesis}
\begin{abstract}
The abstract is a self-contained, concise description of the thesis: what was the problem, what was done, what was the result.
Do not include charts or tables in the abstract.

First include the abstract written in the main language of the thesis and then the translation.
A bachelor's thesis in Finnish must also have a name in English for archival.
\end{abstract}

%Then, the abstract in the other language (explicit language selection) except for bachelor's theses

\chapter*{Preface}
\label{ch:preface}
This document template is designed in accordance with the 2017 version of the TUT thesis writing guide, based on the LaTeX \emph{report} document class and earlier TUT LaTeX templates.

The preface contains general information about the thesis process.
Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally presented in the preface.
It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in the preface, even though the preface will not affect your grade.
The preface must fit on one page.
Add the date, after which you have not made any revisions to the text, at the end of the preface.

The abbreviations and notations used in your thesis are defined collectively at the start of the thesis, and when they appear in the body for the first time.
Parentheses are used with abbreviations then.


% It may be useful to break the chapters into their own files and then do eg. \include{01-introduction} or \include{C-resultsdiscussion}

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

This template is associated with the Tampere University of Technology Thesis Writing Guide.
A thesis or report typically includes the following chapters:

\begin{tabular}[h]{l}
Title page\\
Abstract\\

Preface\\
Contents\\
List of abbreviations and symbols\\
1. Introduction\\
2. Theoretical background\\
3. Research methodology and materials\\
4. Results and analysis (possibly split into separate chapters) \\
5. Conclusions\\
References\\
Appendices (if applicable)
\end{tabular}

Chapter \fullref{ch:literature} of this template covers the basic rules of writing style in regard to figures, tables and mathematical notations.

A documentation of the document class options is given as an appendix.

%\addto\extrasenglish{\btxifchangecaseoff} % Controls the case-changing for English titles. Make sure that case is preserved for abbreviations and proper nouns, e.g. title={The {ABC} of {Tex}: An Introduction to the Typesetting System}
